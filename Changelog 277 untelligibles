Julia Liuson: Great, and I would love for you guys to help me get that word out, because I feel like there's still so many people, even -- it got better this year, but even two years ago, they were like "What? You mean .NET is open source? What? [unintelligible 00:04:41.04] is cross-platform?" It's complete news to them...

Jerod Santo: Well, a lot of those people are listening to our podcast, so I think that's a good thing. An interesting place that I think we could start - because... You know, according to Wikipedia, which - congratulations, you have a Wikipedia page. Is that you? It is you, unless there was somebody else...

Julia Liuson: I don't know, I haven't even looked.

Jerod Santo: Did you not know you have a Wikipedia page?

Julia Liuson: Someone mentioned that to me, but I never looked.

Jerod Santo: Okay. Well, I looked, and I found -- were you born in Shanghai in 1970?

Julia Liuson: Yes, yes.

Jerod Santo: Okay, I figured it was you, because a lot of that information lined up. Live review...

Julia Liuson: [AND That even looks accurate 00:05:27.05] [laughter]
